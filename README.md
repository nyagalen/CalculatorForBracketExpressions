# CalculatorForBracketExpressions
A program that accepts a mathematic expression that can include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers ^, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), - sign, and any number of brackets.
Such as:
sin(2*(-5+1.5*4)+28)
tan(2025 ^ 0.5)
1+(1+(1+1)*(1+1))*(1+1)+1
2*(589+((2454*0.1548/0.01*(-2+9^2))+((25*123.12+45877*25)+25))-547)
-(-2^(-2))+2+(-(-2^(-2)))

The task is recursively with regular expressions, Pattern and Matcher classes.
